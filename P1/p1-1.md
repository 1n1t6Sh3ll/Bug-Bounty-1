## Using Default Credentials

### How to Test

1. The first step is to determine what software is being used.
2. Once the software has been identified, try to find whether it uses default passwords, and if so, what they are. This should include:

    * Searching for “[SOFTWARE] default password”.
    * Reviewing the manual or vendor documentation.
    * Checking common default password databases, such as [CIRT.net](https://cirt.net/passwords), [SecLists Default Passwords](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials) and [DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet.](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/02-Testing_for_Default_Credentials)
    * Inspecting the application source code (if available).
    * Installing the application on a virtual machine and inspecting it.
    * Inspecting the physical hardware for stickers (often present on network devices).
